### Step 2:	Data Classification & Risk Tolerance
**Description:* The purpose of data classification in a risk management report is to categorize data based on its sensitivity, importance, and the level of protection it requires. This helps the organization prioritize security efforts, allocate resources effectively, and implement appropriate controls to safeguard data.  Data classification in a risk management report supports the organization’s efforts to protect its most valuable data assets, manage risks effectively, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

### Step 2.5:	Data Classification & Risk Tolerance
**Description:* The purpose of risk tolerance in a risk management report is to define the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. It provides a framework for decision-making by establishing boundaries within which risks can be managed and mitigated. Risk tolerance is a benchmark for evaluating risks and determining appropriate responses, ensuring that the organization maintains a balance between opportunity and protection.

### Step 3: Risk Assessment (Bread & Butter)
**Description:** The purpose of a risk assessment in a risk management report is to systematically identify, analyze, and evaluate potential risks that could negatively impact an organization. This process is critical for understanding the threats to the organization's assets, operations, and objectives. Overall, risk assessment is a crucial component of risk management, as it provides the detailed insights needed to proactively address potential threats and minimize their impact on the organization.

### Step 4: Risk Mitigation/Acceptance Strategy
**Description:** The purpose of the Risk Mitigation and Acceptance Strategy in a risk management report is to outline the organization's approach to managing identified risks. This section provides a detailed plan for either reducing (mitigating) the risks to an acceptable level or formally accepting the risks based on their assessed impact and likelihood.

### Conclusion: Recommendations
<span style="font-size:0.5em;">Based on the value of the assets to the organization, the probability of event occurrence, and the potential impact, I recommend moving forward with the proposed strategy. We should begin by implementing the base controls over the next year, with a planned evaluation in 2022-2023. Our top priorities are two key assets vital to business operations: our internal web server and customer data, followed by our groundbreaking app and mobile devices. By implementing these controls and maintaining continuous monitoring through automation, supplemented by manual periodic audits, we can ensure that these assets remain within our acceptable risk tolerance. Although setting this baseline will require a significant portion of our budget, given the current global uncertainties and the critical value of these assets, the overall success of our organization needs to have these controls in place.</span>
